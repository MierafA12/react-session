## 📘 What is React?

**React** is a free and open-source **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces** or **UI components**. It was developed by **Facebook (now Meta)** and is widely used in modern web development to create **single-page applications (SPAs)**.

React allows developers to build **interactive UIs** efficiently using **declarative code**, meaning you describe what you want to see and React handles the rendering and updates when your data changes.

React encourages building interfaces using **reusable components**, making code more organized, maintainable, and scalable.

## 🧱 Is React a Framework?

Although React is often referred to as a “framework,” **React is technically a library**, not a full-fledged framework. 

- **Library**: React focuses only on the **view layer** of the application.
- **Framework**: A framework like Angular provides complete tooling (routing, state management, HTTP, etc.).

In React, you can choose your own tools (e.g., React Router for routing, Redux or Context API for state management), giving you **flexibility** but also **responsibility** for structuring your app.

## 🚀 Why Use React?

React has become one of the most popular tools for frontend development, and here’s why:

- ✅ **Component-Based Architecture**: Break down UIs into small, reusable pieces.
- ✅ **Declarative Syntax**: Makes code more readable and predictable.
- ✅ **Fast Rendering**: Uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI.
- ✅ **Strong Community**: Tons of support, libraries, and learning resources.
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works with React Native for mobile development.
- ✅ **SEO-Friendly**: Supports SSR (Server-Side Rendering) through Next.js.

React helps in building **dynamic and performant user experiences** quickly and effectively.

## 📘 What is JSX?

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a **syntax extension** for JavaScript used in **React**. It allows developers to **write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript**, making the code easier to read and understand when working with UI elements.

JSX is not valid JavaScript by itself—it is transformed into regular JavaScript using tools like **Babel** before being rendered by the browser.

## 🛠️ Why Use JSX?

JSX improves development by:

- ✅ Writing UI in a declarative and familiar syntax.
- ✅ Combining markup and logic in a single file.
- ✅ Enabling dynamic rendering using JavaScript expressions.

## 🔍 JSX vs HTML

While JSX looks similar to HTML, there are a few important differences:

| HTML | JSX |
|------|-----|
| `class` | `className` |
| `for` | `htmlFor` |
| Attributes use double quotes | Attributes use curly braces for JS expressions |

Example:

```jsx
// JSX
const element = <h1 className="title">Welcome</h1>;
