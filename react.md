## 📜 History of React

React was developed by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer at Facebook, and was first deployed in 2011 on Facebook's news feed. It was later released as an open-source project in **May 2013**. React revolutionized front-end development with its **component-based architecture**, **virtual DOM**, and later with **hooks** in React 16.8.

Today, React is maintained by **Meta (formerly Facebook)** and is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces in web and mobile applications.

## 🔹 What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces, primarily for **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It allows developers to create **reusable UI components** and manage state efficiently.

### Key Features of React:
- **Component-Based**: UI is broken down into reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM**: Enhances performance by updating only changed parts of the UI.
- **Declarative UI**: Simplifies UI design by describing how UI should look at different states.
- **State Management**: Manages application state effectively with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Ensures better predictability and debugging.

## 🧰 What is a Framework?

A **framework** is a collection of pre-written code that provides a structured way to build applications. Unlike **libraries**, which offer specific functions to be called when needed, a **framework dictates the architecture and flow** of an application.

### Difference Between a Library and a Framework:
| Type       | Library                        | Framework                        |
|------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Control    | You call the library           | The framework calls your code    |
| Flexibility| High                           | Moderate to low                  |
| Examples   | React (library), Lodash        | Angular, Vue.js                  |

## 🔁 Difference Between React and Vite

React and Vite serve different purposes but are commonly used **together** in modern web development.

| Feature          | React              | Vite                           |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Type**         | JavaScript Library | Build Tool / Dev Server       |
| **Purpose**      | UI Development     | Fast Development & Build System |
| **Usage**        | Creates UI components | Optimizes dev experience       |
| **Performance**  | Handles UI efficiently | Super fast builds & HMR        |
| **Configuration**| Needs tooling (e.g., Webpack) | Zero-config, modern tooling |
| **Hot Reloading**| Available with CRA/Webpack | Lightning-fast with ES Modules |

### Why Use React with Vite?

Vite offers an optimized development experience for React projects with:
- **Faster Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**
- **Lightweight and optimized builds**
- **Built-in support** for TypeScript, JSX, and CSS
- **Minimal configuration** compared to Create React App (CRA)

## ⚙️ Installing React with Vite

To start a React project using Vite:


```sh
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev

## 📁 Folder Structure and Installed Modules in Vite

```bash
my-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── react.svg
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.css
│   └── main.jsx
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── README.md

## Folder Structure and Installed Modules
After running `npx create-react-app my-app`, the following folder structure and modules will be installed:

### Folder Structure:
```
my-app/
│── node_modules/    # Contains installed dependencies
│── public/          # Static assets like index.html, favicon, and manifest.json
│── src/             # Source code (React components, styles, etc.)
│   │── App.js       # Main React component
│   │── index.js     # Entry point of the app
│   │── index.css    # Global styles
│   │── logo.svg     # React logo file
│   └── ...         
│── .gitignore       # Specifies files to ignore in Git
│── package.json     # Project metadata and dependencies
│── README.md        # Project documentation
│── package-lock.json # Locks dependency versions
```

### Explanation of Folders:
- **`node_modules/`**: Contains all installed npm dependencies and packages.
- **`public/`**:
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves the React app.
  - `favicon.ico`: The website's favicon (small icon in browser tab).
  - `manifest.json`: Metadata for Progressive Web App (PWA) support.
- **`src/`**:
  - `App.js`: The main component of the application.
  - `index.js`: The entry point where React is rendered into the DOM.
  - `index.css`: Global CSS styles for the app.
  - `logo.svg`: Default React logo.
- **`.gitignore`**: Prevents unnecessary files from being committed to Git.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project details, dependencies, and scripts.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Ensures consistent dependency versions across installs.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

### Key Installed Modules:
- **react**: Core React library.
- **react-dom**: Allows React to interact with the DOM.
- **react-scripts**: Scripts and configurations for development and build.
- **webpack**: Bundles JavaScript files.
- **babel**: Transpiles modern JavaScript (JSX, ES6+) to browser-compatible code.
- **eslint**: Linter to enforce code quality.
- **jest**: Testing framework for unit tests.

This setup provides everything needed to start building a React application without additional configuration.

## Import and Export in React
React follows ES6 module syntax for importing and exporting components.

### Exporting Components:
You can export a component in two ways:

1. **Named Export**:
```jsx
export const MyComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};
```

2. **Default Export**:
```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};
export default MyComponent;
```

### Importing Components:
To use an exported component in another file:

1. **Named Import** (must match the exported name):
```jsx
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';
```

2. **Default Import** (any name can be used):
```jsx
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```

---

## Styling in React
React allows multiple ways to style components:

### 1. **CSS Stylesheets**
You can import a CSS file in a component:
```jsx
import './styles.css';
```

### 2. **Inline Styles**
Using the `style` prop with a JavaScript object:
```jsx
const styles = {
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: '20px',
};
```

### 3. **CSS Modules**
Scoped styles using `.module.css` files:
```jsx
import styles from './MyComponent.module.css';
```

### 4. **Styled-Components (CSS-in-JS)**
Using the `styled-components` library:
```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

---

## Routing in React
React Router is used to enable navigation between different components in a React application.

### Installing React Router:
```sh
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Basic Routing Setup:
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
export default App;
```
# React Component 

This document introduces React components and demonstrates a simple example of a component that includes a button.

## 📘 What is a React Component?

In React, a **component** is a reusable piece of UI. Components can be either **functional** or **class-based**, but functional components are now more common, especially with the introduction of **Hooks**.

```jsx
# React Functional Component: Simple Alert Button

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const AlertButton = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Simple Alert Example</h2>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AlertButton;

in the app or anather page 

import React from 'react';
import AlertButton from './AlertButton';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <AlertButton />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
